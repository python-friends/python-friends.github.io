<p><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> is the best general propose programming langue. From motors and microcontrollers to neural networks and data frames Python has something for everyone. With this great generality comes a diverse community that we hope to foster at JCU.</p>
<p>We started python-friends to bring individuals together to share in the joy of Python.</p>
