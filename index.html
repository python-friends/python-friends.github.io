  It only took all of Saturday, but I finshed the stage driver protoype for our progamable mircoscope project: Auto-Scope.
</p>
<img src="images/auto-scope-1.png"><img src="images/auto-scope-2.png"><p>
  The design is pretty simple; there are two mounting points on stage that I chose to use to support the unit.
  The unit is designed to be modular for easy printing and upgrading.
  I had to print a few parts along the way while I iterated on the design, but it's now looking pretty good. 
  The final design is currently printing on my CR-10 and will hopefully come out as depicted above. 
  Once it's assembled the real fun (aka the Python) can start! 
</p>

<h3>EDIT: 19/8/18</h3>

<p>
  The print has finished, and I've assembled the stage driver unit onto my OMAX microscope (see below). Overall I'm happy with the design. However, there are a few changes I'd like to make in V2.
  </p>
<ul>
<li>The text on the top of the unit didn't work, possibly because the top section is printed upsidedown?</li>
    <li>I accounted for a 0.1mm gap in the joint design; however it did require some sanding to get them fitting nicely.</li>
    <li>Although the assembled unit is small, it's not small enough. Currently, you have to remove the microscope base to attach it.</li> 
  </ul>
  If you're interested in looking at my design in person come to next Mondays python-friends meetup, we'll be trying to get this thing to move!

  At the last meeting, the group decided that python-friends should take a more hands-on project based turn. The nominate project is to build an open source whole slide scanner and automated cell discrimination and counting system. This project will involve many aspects of Python programming from controlling motors to building deep learning classifiers. We will work on this project at the weekly meetings. All are welcome to contribute, and no previous background is required.

  Counting 80,000+ blood cells by hand will drive anyone to search for alternatives. A recent project I worked on involved looking for parasites in freshwater turtle blood cells (lots of turtle blood cells...).
  Due to the exotic nature of turtle cells, there are no readily available cell counting systems, and with the prospect of counting another 100,000+ cells I think we need to make one. Luckily we have <a href="https://xkcd.com/353/">Python super powers</a>!
</p>
<p>
  The first part of the project involves designing motor mounts to control the stage and focus. I'm going to work on this over the weekend, and hopefully, we'll have a system to start prototyping code on Monday.

I built this blog using the Python-based static site generator - Nikola. Learn more at the  <a href="https://getnikola.com">Nikola website</a><a></a>.
</p>
<p>
I used a nifty little Python tool called <a href="https://github.com/drdoctr/doctr">doctr</a> to connect the blog to <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a>. Now fully equipped with continuous integration the site will be rebuilt and deployed with each push to the <a href="https://github.com/python-friends/python-friends.github.io/tree/src">src branch</a>.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully you'll see the build passing here...
