<p>
  Well it only took all of Saturday, but I finshed the protoype of the Auto-Scope stage driver.

  The design is pretty simple; there are two mounting points on stage that I chose to use to support the unit.
  The unit is designed to be modular for easy printing and upgrading.
  I had to print a few parts along the way while I iterated on the design, but it's now looking pretty good. 
  The final design is currently printing on my CR-10 and will hopefully come out as depicted above. 
  Once it's assembled the real fun (aka the Python) can start!
