<p>
  It only took all of Saturday, but I finshed the stage driver protoype for our progamable mircoscope project: Auto-Scope.

  The design is pretty simple; there are two mounting points on stage that I chose to use to support the unit.
  The unit is designed to be modular for easy printing and upgrading.
  I had to print a few parts along the way while I iterated on the design, but it's now looking pretty good. 
  The final design is currently printing on my CR-10 and will hopefully come out as depicted above. 
  Once it's assembled the real fun (aka the Python) can start!

<h3>UPDATE: 19/8/18</h3>

<p>
  The print has finished, and I've assembled the stage driver unit onto my OMAX microscope (see below). Overall I'm happy with the design. However, there are a few changes I'd like to make in V2.
  <ul>
    <li>The text on the top of the unit didn't work, possibly because the top section is printed upsidedown?</li>
    <li>I accounted for a 0.1mm gap in the joint design; however it did require some sanding to get them fitting nicely.</li>
    <li>Although the assembled unit is small, it's not small enough. Currently, you have to remove the microscope base to attach it.</li> 
  </ul>
  If you're interested in looking at my design in person come to next Mondays python-friends meetup, we'll be trying to get this thing to move!
