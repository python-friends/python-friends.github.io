  It only took all of Saturday, but I finshed the stage driver protoype for our progamable mircoscope project: Auto-Scope.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  The design is pretty simple; there are two mounting points on stage that I chose to use to support the unit.
  The unit is designed to be modular for easy printing and upgrading.
  I had to print a few parts along the way while I iterated on the design, but it's now looking pretty good. 
  The final design is currently printing on my CR-10 and will hopefully come out as depicted above. 
  Once it's assembled the real fun (aka the Python) can start! 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;UPDATE: 19/8/18&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  The print has finished, and I've assembled the stage driver unit onto my OMAX microscope (see below). Overall I'm happy with the design. However, there are a few changes I'd like to make in V2.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The text on the top of the unit didn't work, possibly because the top section is printed upsidedown?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I accounted for a 0.1mm gap in the joint design; however it did require some sanding to get them fitting nicely.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Although the assembled unit is small, it's not small enough. Currently, you have to remove the microscope base to attach it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Lots of screws...&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  If you're interested in looking at my design in person come to next Mondays python-friends meetup, we'll be trying to get this thing to move!
